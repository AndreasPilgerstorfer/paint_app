# paint_app

In this project I have created a paint application using object oriented JavaScript/jQuery, HTML and CSS. The user has the opportunity to select between six shapes (Square, Rectangle, Frame, Oval, Stick-Figure and Triangle) and he/she is able to choose the size and position of the different shapes. By clicking the draw button, the shape gets drawn at the chosen position on the drawing area. By clicking on the "Delete all objects" button, all the shapes get erased from the area. It is also possible to directly click on the drawing area. In this case the selected object gets drawn with the selected size at the location of the cursor. By clicking on an already existing shape, it is possible to erase the selected shape.
